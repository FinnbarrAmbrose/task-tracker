# Task Manager Application Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Task Manager Application project, an engaging and practical learning experience designed by Code Institute. This project is part of a series aimed at providing hands-on training in relational database management through the development of a full-featured web application.

## Project Overview

In this mini-project, participants will build a Task Manager application using Flask, the SQLAlchemy ORM, and the Materialize frontend framework. The project is structured to guide learners through implementing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality within a Flask application, allowing for dynamic interaction with a database.

## Learning Outcomes

By participating in this project, learners will:

- Gain practical experience in setting up and interacting with a relational database using Flask and SQLAlchemy.
- Develop frontend interfaces using HTML and the Materialize framework to manage and display data effectively.
- Learn to implement and style user interfaces that provide a seamless user experience with responsive design.
- Understand the principles of Material Design and how to apply them using Materialize, a modern frontend framework based on Google's design language.

## Why This Project?

This project serves as a practical exercise for those looking to deepen their understanding of database management systems and web application development. It is designed to be accessible for beginners yet challenging enough to provide valuable insights and skills that can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Flask**: A micro web framework written in Python, used for building web applications.
- **SQLAlchemy**: An ORM (Object Relational Mapper) that allows developers to interact with a database using Python instead of SQL.
- **Materialize**: A responsive frontend framework based on Material Design by Google, which helps in creating attractive, consistent, and functional user interfaces.
